# Unix Shell Programming

This repository holds the material for the seminar on `Unix Shell Programming` organized by the Department of Industrial Engineering of the University of Trento. Use this material to follow along with the seminar and to practice the concepts discussed.

## Pre-requisites

- A Unix-like operating system (Linux, macOS, WSL on Windows).
- A terminal emulator (e.g., `bash`, `zsh`, `fish`). We will use `bash` in this seminar, but the concepts are applicable to other shells as well.
- A text editor (e.g., `vim`, `nano`, `gedit`, `sublime`, `vscode`). We will use `vim` in this seminar, but you can use any text editor you are comfortable with.
- Basic knowledge of the Unix command line. We will quickly review the basics, but it is recommended to have some prior experience with the Unix command line.
- Basic knowledge of programming concepts. We will quickly review the basics, but it is recommended to have some prior experience with programming.
