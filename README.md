This repository holds the material for the seminar on `Unix Shell Programming` organised by the Department of Industrial Engineering of the University of Trento. Use this material to follow along with the seminar and to practice the concepts discussed.

## Pre-requisites

- A Unix-like operating system (Linux, macOS, WSL on Windows).
- A terminal emulator (e.g., `bash`, `zsh`, `fish`). We will use `bash` in this seminar, but the concepts are applicable to other shells as well.
- A text editor (e.g., `vim`, `nano`, `gedit`, `sublime`, `vscode`). We will use `vim` in this seminar, but you can use any text editor you are comfortable with.
- Basic knowledge of the Unix command line. We will quickly review the basics, but it is recommended to have some prior experience with the Unix command line.
- Basic knowledge of programming concepts. We will quickly review the basics, but it is recommended to have some prior experience with programming.

## Timetable

We will divide the 8-hour seminar into four 2-hour sessions over the course of two days. The timetable is as follows:

- **27/06/2024**
  - 09:00 – 11:00: Introduction to Unix Shell Programming
  - 14:00 – 16:00: Unix Shell Programming: theory
- **28/06/2024**
  - 09:00 – 11:00, Unix Shell Programming: hands-on practice
  - 14:00 – 16:00: Exam
